## Problem Description
### Part 1:

We often interface with web APIs of applications to read and write data. We would like you to write a small program or script that accesses the BitBucket API.  Your code should pull the commit messages from all of the check-ins for the repository linked below, then write those messages and their timestamps to a text file in reverse chronological order.  

Repository location: https://bitbucket.org/calanceus/interviews17 

The solution can be in any language you choose.

### Part 2: 

For the second part, we would like you to send your code into that same repository.
